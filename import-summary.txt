ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .gitignore
* build.xml
* lib/
* lib/myjson-1.7.1.jar
* proguard-project.txt
* tests/
* tests/.classpath
* tests/.gitignore
* tests/.project
* tests/AndroidManifest.xml
* tests/ant.properties
* tests/build.xml
* tests/proguard-project.txt
* tests/project.properties
* tests/res/
* tests/res/drawable-hdpi/
* tests/res/drawable-hdpi/icon.png
* tests/res/drawable-ldpi/
* tests/res/drawable-ldpi/icon.png
* tests/res/drawable-mdpi/
* tests/res/drawable-mdpi/icon.png
* tests/res/layout/
* tests/res/layout/main.xml
* tests/res/values/
* tests/res/values/strings.xml
* tests/src/
* tests/src/com/
* tests/src/com/mobiperf/
* tests/src/com/mobiperf/speedometer/

* tests/src/com/mobiperf/speedometer/test/TestHttpTask.java
* tests/src/com/mobiperf/speedometer/test/TestMeasurementTaskBase.java
* tests/src/com/mobiperf/speedometer/test/TestPingTask.java
* tests/src/com/mobiperf/speedometer/test/TestSchedulerBasic.java

* tests/src/com/mobiperf/speedometer/test/UtilTest.java

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* libs/myjson-1.7.1.jar => app/libs/myjson-1.7.1.jar
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
